I'm not even going to try to pretend that I did this, because it would not go well. Not only did I completely forget that this was a thing I needed to do, I also just don't work like that. I don't really even plan when I'm going to work on my code, much less what I'm going to do when I work on it. I just kind of start working on impulse when I have some free time, and work on the most important part for about 5 minutes before I get sidetracked and go off on a tangent towards some other part of the code. ADHD is so much fun.
