Note: I'm not going to pseudocode a lot of the minor functions (colored printing, finding lengths, etc), since either I've already written them for another another project or they're simple enough that they don't need advance planning.

Program start:

Create string vectors for names, tableIncomes, tableGPAs, and tableAges; set the first item of each to the name of the category.
Create float vectors to temporarily hold the values for incomes, GPAs, and ages.

Get user input for a name (string), income (float), and GPA (float); store each one in their respective vectors. Do this 4 times.

Fill the tableIncomes and tableGPAs vectors by taking each income/GPA float, rounding it to two places, truncating any trailing zeroes, converting it to a string, and pushing it to its respective vector. [Incomes are preceded by a $]

Construct a GPATable vector containing names, tableIncomes, and tableGPAs (in that order).
Use dynamicTable (See dynamicTable_PC.txt for how tablePrinter works. Yes, it's that complicated.) to print the GPATable vector as a table.

Reset names, incomes, and tableIncomes to their original values.

Repeat the above using ages in place of incomes to construct and print the AgeTable.

End program.
